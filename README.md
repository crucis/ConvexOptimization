# Convex Optimization

Personal repository for algorithms implemented for my master's degrees class. All algorithms implemented based on Boyd and Vandenberghe's Convex Optimization book and Practical Optimization
Algorithms and Engineering Applications from Antonious and Lu.

```
CPE 773 - Convex Optimization
Professor: Wallace A. Martins
COPPE/UFRJ - Brazil
```
All optimization algorithms are implemented on [models/optimizers](models/optimizers) folder. A [function](functions/functionObj.py) object should always be passed to keep track of all its iterations, evaluations and gradients.
For some examples, please check [tests folder](tests/)

Exercises made for this class (might be in brazilian portuguese):
1. [Lista 1](Exercises/ExerciciosLista1.ipynb)
